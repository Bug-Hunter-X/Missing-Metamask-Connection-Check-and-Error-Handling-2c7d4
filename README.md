This example demonstrates a common error in DApps: insufficient error handling when interacting with user wallets. The initial code assumes the MetaMask wallet is always available and connected, leading to unexpected behavior or crashes if the user doesn't have Metamask or hasn't connected it.  The solution introduces robust error handling and a more reliable way to check the wallet connection status.
